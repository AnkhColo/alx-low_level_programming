This project is about debugging.

The rubber duck debugging method is very effective for this.

The method is summarized as:
Get stuck writing code

Get your rubber duck and explain the overall process or aim of your code

Explain the code line by line and its function

Notice the error made!

You've identified the error, fix it! 

You're done! Congratulate yourself!
